## Basic File and Directory Operations

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| cd      | The cd (change directory) command in Linux is used to navigate between directories in the file system. When you use cd, you can move to a different directory, either relative to your current position or from an absolute path.|
| ls      | The ls command in Linux is used to list the contents of a directory. By default, it shows the names of the files and directories in the current working directory.
| pwd     | The pwd (print working directory) command in Linux is used to display the current working directory. When you execute pwd in a terminal, it shows the absolute path of the directory you are currently working in.|
| mkdir   | The mkdir (make directories) command in Linux is used to create one or more directories.|
| touch   | The touch command in Linux is primarily used to create empty files or update the access and modification timestamps of existing files.|
| cp      | The cp (copy) command in Linux is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. It is a fundamental command for file management in Unix-like systems.|
| mv      | The mv (move) command in Linux is used to move or rename files and directories. It operates by either relocating a file/directory from one location to another or changing the name of a file or directory within the same location.|
| rm      | The rm (remove) command in Linux is used to remove files and directories, and is one of the most commonly used commands for file deletion in Unix-like operating systems.|
| cat     | The cat command in Linux is a versatile utility used for reading, displaying, and concatenating (joining) text files. It is one of the most commonly used commands for working with text files in Linux and Unix-like operating systems.|
| more    | The more command in Linux is a simple utility used to view the contents of a file one screen at a time. It's useful when dealing with large files, allowing you to scroll through the file rather than displaying everything at once.|
| less    | The less command in Linux is a powerful utility used for viewing the contents of a file or the output of a command one screen at a time. It is particularly useful for navigating large files that might be too big to open all at once in a text editor.|
